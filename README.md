# sql-challenge

Documents attached: 
-The CSV files, these files are in the "data" folder. Two of them were modified for simplifying the import process. 

-The ERD shows the connection between the tables, each table exhibits the primary key (the variable with a key and the text in blue), the foreign key (the variable in Bold), all the variables with their data type. 
the dept_emp table doesnÂ´t have a unique column so two primary keys were select so they can be used as a composite key. 

-The data_shema.sql is the file that contains the structure of each of the tables shown in the ERD, also contains the connections between the tables, this code was made with the help of "app.quickdatabasediagrams.com". In this page the ERD was made and from the diagram the page generates a sql code that helped with the task.

-The data_analysis.sql file, contains the code for all the asked information. This code runs afert importing all the csv files on pgAdmin. For most of the questions a "merge" of tables was needed and also some filters.
